# Decap CMS for Next.js Projects

This template is set up for a serverless Git-based CMS for Next.js projects. It is built with (Decap)[https://decapcms.org/] . Note that we also added Material UI bundled within the project as the UI framework to work with. 

To use this template you have to set up a Netlify site and configure the configs as per   (Decap's  next.js documentation)[https://decapcms.org/docs/nextjs/]
