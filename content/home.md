The **Salud Urbana en Am√©rica Latina** (SALURBAL) Project is funded by the Wellcome Trust to study the ways urban environments and urban policies impact health. Since 2017, SALURBAL has worked to compile and harmonize data on social, economic, environmental, and health conditions for nearly 400 cities across Latin America.

This data is free and publicly available and can be used to describe and study associations between the built, social, and natural environments and urban health across the region.
